## Conclusion

Looking at data visuals of some of the most horrific crimes may easily
desensitize individuals. This is why I chose a small quote from the
Tattooed Soldier, a fictional novel about the Civil Wars in Guatemala,
to leave off: “This was the worst thing to remember \[from the war\],
the sounds children make when they are dying. The flutter in the throat.
Crying because they’re bleeding all over the floor and it doesn’t make
sense.” (p.65)
