## Conclusion

El Salvador had far more attacks than Guatemala, largely due to the FMLN group, who was extremely more active in El Salvador than Guatemala. This group's attack methods were particularly horrific, considering they kidnapped children from a young age for forced recruitment.  

Overall, Guatemala had fewer recorded attacks, which leads me to believe that the data might be incomplete or skewed in some way. The patterns of violence in both countries, however, are strikingly similar when it comes to the Death Squad group, which seemed equally active in both countries. But what’s interesting is that Left-Wing Terrorists and Guerrillas in each country seemed to use different methods, possibly because they were adapting to the different socio-political situations.

Looking at data visuals of some of the most horrific crimes may easily
desensitize individuals. This is why I chose a small quote from *The
Tattooed Soldier* to remind us of the humanity behind this violence: 

“This was the worst thing to remember \[from the war\],
the sounds children make when they are dying. The flutter in the throat.
Crying because they’re bleeding all over the floor and it doesn’t make
sense.” (p.65)

This quote serves as a reminder that, while data is essential for grasping the 
scope of violence or injustice, it is ultimately the human stories behind those
numbers that allow us to truly comprehend the depth of suffering.
