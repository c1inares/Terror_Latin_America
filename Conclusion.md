## Conclusion

Looking at data visuals of some of the most horrific crimes may easily
desensitize individuals. This is why I chose a small quote from the
Tattooed Soldier, a fictional novel about the Civil Wars in Guatemala,
to leave off: “This was the worst thing to remember \[from the war\],
the sounds children make when they are dying. The flutter in the throat.
Crying because they’re bleeding all over the floor and it doesn’t make
sense.” (p.65)

This quote serves as a reminder that, while data is essential for grasping the 
scope of violence or injustice, it is ultimately the human stories behind those
numbers that allow us to truly comprehend the depth of suffering.
