# Terror_Latin_America

For my project, I will analyze the terrorist attacks that occurred in Guatemala and El Salvador between 1970 and 2017, using both historical data and literature to deepen the understanding of political violence in Latin America. A key resource is *The Tattooed Soldiers*, a historic fictional novel by HÃ©ctor Tobar that provides a detailed portrayal of the lives of immigrants during the civil war in Guatemala. In addition, I collected data from the Global Terrorism Database and Kaggle (link provided below). Since the data in Latin America can sometimes be limited due to inconsistent record-keeping, I also incorporated insights from my parents, who experienced the crisis firsthand in El Salvador. This combination of statistical data and personal experiences allows for a more detailed look at regional forces that influenced the violence in both countries.
