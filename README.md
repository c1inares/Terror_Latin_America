# terror_latin_america

For my project, I decided to analyze the terrorist attacks that occurred in Guatemala and El Salvador between 1970 and 2017, using The Tattooed Soldiers, a historical novel that provides a detailed portrayal of the civil wars in both countries. I collected my data from Kaggle, link provided below, and the Global Terrorism Database. Since the data can sometimes be limited due to lack of record documentation in Latin America, I gathered some information from my parents who lived through this crisis.
