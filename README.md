# Terror_Latin_America

For my project, I decided to analyze the terrorist attacks that occurred in Guatemala and El Salvador between 1970 and 2017, using The Tattooed Soldiers, a historical novel that provides a detailed portrayal of the civil wars in both countries. I collected my data from Kaggle (link provided below) and the Global Terrorism Database. Since the data in Latin America can sometimes be scarce due to inconsistent record-keeping, I also incorporated insights from my parents, who experienced the crisis firsthand in El Salvador.
