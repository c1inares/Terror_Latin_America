# terror_latin_america

For my project, I decided to analyze Guatemala's and El Salvador's terrorist attacks. Considering the Tattooed Soldiers discusses in great length the Civil Wars happening in both countries, I decided to analyze the congruent information we have. I collected my data from Kaggle, link provided below, and the Global Terrorism Database. Since the data can sometimes be limited due to lack of record documentation in Latin America, I gathered some information from my parents who lived through this crisis.
